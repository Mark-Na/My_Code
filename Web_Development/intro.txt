when opening a website we send a packet to the internet hub which asks for permission to see a website and then it goes to the server that the website is hosted on 
then when the request is sent to the server, the server sends the information through different means so it can get back to the user's computer

query is submitted to isp
the isp, the dns takes the domain name and turns it into ip address
request is sent to desired ip address
reuest finds fastest path to the server with specified ip
not a direct journey, bounces from server to server
requested server figures out what we are asking for
server builds the right content by pulling info from database
server responds with any combination of HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT
can view any underlying html css and javascript on any webpage
on chrome right click and select view page source
or select view > developer > view source
ctrl+u 

front end is stuff ypu see and interact with : HTML CCSS JAVASCRIPT
Back end is everything else
Like a restaurant, backend is kitchen, front end is what is plated and sent to the table
